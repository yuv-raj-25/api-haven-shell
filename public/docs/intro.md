# Introduction

Welcome to **API Haven** — a lightweight app for composing, organizing, and sending HTTP requests.

This documentation provides a guided tour of the app, explains how collections and requests work, and shows how to use the built-in request runner and expected backend API.

- Quick start: Open Workspace → create a collection → add a request → set method & URL → Send.
- Persistence: Requests are saved locally (localStorage) and will be sent to the backend when available.

Learn more using the sidebar topics on the left.

Below are some quick pointers to make requests look good and be reliable:

- Use `Content-Type: application/json` for JSON bodies.
- Keep request names descriptive so collections are easy to scan.
- Save commonly used headers in your workspace and reuse them across requests.
